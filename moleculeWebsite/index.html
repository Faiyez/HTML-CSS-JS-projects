            <h1>Water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. </h1>

            <h1>Structure of water molecule</h1>
            <p>Water is made of three atoms, an oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, and thus is both a molecule and a compound. A chemical formula is an abbreviation that shows which atoms are in the molecule and in what quantity. For example, the chemical formula for water is H2O. This means that water has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, the chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2, meaning there are two oxygen atoms and two hydrogen atoms. </p>
